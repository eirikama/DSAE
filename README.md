# Descattering Autoencoder

Implementation of Descattering Autoencoder (DSAE) for Mie-scatter correction of FT-IR 
spectra of cells and tissues.

The DSAE takes measured scatter-distorted spectra as input and yields 
scatter corrected spectra. The model is intended to be trained on a subset of measured spectra 
which have been scatter-corrected by the state-of-the-art Mie-scatter correction method Mie Extinction Extended
Multiplicative Signal Correction (ME-EMSC) algorithm.

The pretrained model should be used on spectra at wavenumbers between 910 and 3623.
